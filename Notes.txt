1. Maintenance Lights for color wheel function don't work properly if the LDP isn't
   on the color wheel as well. It just stalls and won't change color.  Need to modify the
   Arduino code to fix this.

2. Pulse Beat 2 - the VU strips aren't transitioning properly at the top.  This
   is probably due to the fact that I'm using 7 instead of 9.  Need to modify the
   Arduino code to fix this.

3. Maintenence Lights for WigWag aren't working properly.  Not all the LEDs are lighting up.
   Look at the Arduino code for this.

4. FIXED - VU Front Logic Display function has green in it.  It should only be white and blue.

5. Setup auto sounds in Settings
