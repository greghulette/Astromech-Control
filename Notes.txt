1. Maintenance Lights for color wheel function don't work properly if the LDP isn't
   on the color wheel as well. It just stalls and won't change color.  Need to modify the
   Arduino code to fix this.

2. Pulse Beat 2 - the VU strips aren't transitioning properly at the top.  This
   is probably due to the fact that I'm using 7 instead of 9.  Need to modify the
   Arduino code to fix this.
