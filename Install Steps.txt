This is a high level install instructions.

1. Go to raspberry.org and download the latest installer.  I chose to use the installer rather then downloading the
    image and burning it to the SD card.  It was a much easier method then downloading the image.
    I'm using the "Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) with desktop".

2. Rotate the LCD screen.  I do this because of the way it's mounted in my droid.  You may not have to perform this step.
    In Terminal, type "sudo nano /boot/config.txt"
    Add the line "lcd_rotate=2" to the top of the file.
    Press CTRL+X
    Then Y
    Then Enter
    Then reboot

3. Go through setup process

4. Enable SSH, I2C, SSH Console

5.  I SSH'd into the pi but you can connect a KVM to it if you'd like.

6.  clone GitHub repository "https://github.com/greghulette/Astromech-Control.git"

7. Install Node.js  //this installs version 14 onto the raspbery pi
  curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
  sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

8. Install dependencies
   npm install

9. Enable VNC (Remote Desktop Connection)  I did this for programming and ease of file manipulation.  Not needed

10. Install Geany

11. install Arduino

12. Make node.js run by default when booting
  mkdir ~/.config/lxsession
  cd ~/.config/lxsession
  mkdir/LXDE-pi
  cd LXDE-pi
  nano autostart

  Type the following in the autostart file:
  @lxpanel --profile LXDE-pi
  @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE-pi
  @lxterminal --command "/home/pi/Astromech-Control/start.sh"
  @xscreensaver SHAPE_REPRESENTATION_RELATIONSHIP

  nano start.sh
